# Custom views in Iconify Icon Finder

Custom view is similar to search results view, except that it uses custom source for icons list. You must set icons list when view is being initialised. You can do that asynchronously, similar to querying API for search results.

Custom view is used for things like bookmarked icons, recent icons list.
